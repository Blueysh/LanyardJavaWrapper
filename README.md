# LanyardJavaWrapper
**LanyardJavaWrapper** is, obviously, a Java wrapper for the Lanyard API, which you can find [here](https://github.com/phineas/lanyard).

**Lanyard** is a REST API that exposes Discord users' data within a seconds.
In order to be monitored by Lanyard, you need to be in the [**Lanyard Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/UrXF2cfJ7F). Once you've done that, you can start using your Discord info in your app as you please.

### Builds
Currently, LanyardJavaWrapper is only available on Jitpack [here](https://jitpack.io/#blueysh/lanyardjavawrapper).
Eventually I'll transition away from it, but for now you can find everything you need there.

### Bugs
If you find any issues or bugs **please report them!!** You can also open a pull request to contribute your fix as long as it doesn't drastically change the functionality of the library.
